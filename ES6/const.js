// JavaScript const
// The const keyword allows you to declare a constant (a JavaScript variable with a constant value).

// Constants are similar to let variables, except that the value cannot be changed.

var x = 10;
// Here x is 10
console.log(x);
{
  const x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
  console.log(x);
}
// Here x is 10
console.log(x);
